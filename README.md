<!-- creating popup chat bot using html/CSS and java script 
In this web development tutorial, we will see how to create a basic chatbot 
using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This exercise is focused on JS fundamentals 
rather than any kind of Artificial Intelligence (AI). To make the process simpler and easier to learn, 
I am not using any third-party libraries. I will be building the chatbot from scratch by focusing on the basics of the JavaScript programming language. -->
